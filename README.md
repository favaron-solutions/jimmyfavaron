## Local Deployment
If you want to deploy it locally then you need to execute the following commands.
Requirements:
- [git](https://git-scm.com/doc) installed
- [nodejs and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed

Download the code

```git clone https://github.com/jfavaron/jimmyfavaron.git```

Navigate into the code directory

```cd jimmyfavaron```

Install dependencies for the project

```npm install```

Spin up the react application.

```npm start```

At this point your default browser should automatically be opened to the homepage.
