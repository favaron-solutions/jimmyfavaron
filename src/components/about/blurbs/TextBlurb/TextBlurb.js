        Hey.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My name is Jimmy and I am a creator, fixer, and dreamer.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I studied Physics and Mathematics while at University and in the process found a passion for coding. 
        I enjoy software development, web hosting, home networking, hardware repair, automations, and basically anything that has to do with technology and science.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My blog posts will consist mostly of projects I've worked on, both software and hardware, IT tips, and many other science and nerd culture topics that my friends come up with.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, watching sports (Go Spurs Go!), and working on my home automation setup.
